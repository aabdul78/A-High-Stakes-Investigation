A High Stakes Investigation

Scenario You have just been hired by Lucky Duck Casino as a security analyst. Lucky Duck has lost a significant amount of money on the roulette tables over the last month. The largest losses occurred on March 10, 12, and 15. Your manager believes there is a player working with a Lucky Duck dealer to steal money at the roulette tables. The casino has a large database with data on wins and losses, player analysis, and dealer schedules. You are tasked with navigating, modifying, and analyzing these data files to gather evidence on the rogue player and dealer. You will prepare several evidence files to assist the prosecution. You must work quickly as Lucky Duck can't afford any more losses. Lucky Duck Casino has provided you with the following files if required:

Roulette Player Data: Week of March 10 Employee Dealer Schedule: Week of March

Instructions Use your command-line skills to uncover the identities of the rogue casino player and dealer colluding to scam Lucky Duck out of thousands of dollars.


To prepare for the investigation, I initiated the process by executing the mkdir command to establish a primary directory named Lucky_Duck_Investigations. Subsequently, within this main directory, I proceeded to create additional subdirectories essential for commencing the investigative process.

In this directory, create a directory for this specific investigation titled Roulette_Loss_Investigation. In Roulette_Loss_Investigation, create the following directories: Player_Analysis to investigate the casino player. Dealer_Analysis to investigate the dealers. Player_Dealer_Correlation to summarize your findings of the collusion. Create empty files called Notes_ under each subdirectory to store investigation notes. For example: Notes_Player_Analysis
